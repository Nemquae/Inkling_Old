Inkling
============

openframeworks app. Combines fluid simulations with learning curve estimation and assessment.  Should be fun too.

DEPENDENCIES & SYSTEM SPECS

- This version of the app was created using Windows 10 and OF 0.9.3
- The addon should work on older versions of Windows, OSX and Linux.
- dependent on ofxGui.
- dependent on ofxFlowTools
- dependent on ofxInkSim
- A discrete graphics card is recommended.


INTRODUCTION

In Inkling, you create and then control an abstract character in a fluid world to solve puzzles and engage with others in dynamic terrains composed of green, blue, and red ink.  The effect is much like living within a world of mixing colors, alternating between tranquil exploration of fantastical patterns and careful navigation of free-flowing puzzles.  The design borrows from the Suminagashi style of painting (also known as Paper Marbling) and classic games like Conway's Game of Life (also see SmoothLife), as well as many modern games, such as flOw, Spore Origins, Osmos, PixelJunk Shooter, Agar.io, Slither.io, and the Falling Sand (1, 2, 3) series (also see BurningSand).  Notably, it differs from these by embracing a fully fluid-dynamic environment and a strong focus on ease of play.  Our primary goal is to enable all audiences to learn and grow through play, especially those with special educational needs.  As a mobile and tablet game, we hope to provide as pleasurable and educational an experience as possible in a brief window of time.
